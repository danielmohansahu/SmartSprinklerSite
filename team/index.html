<h2 id="toni">Toni</h2>

<p>Toni is a first year M.S. Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Tech. He received his B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of California San Diego in 2015. He is currently part of the Technology Transition Lab at Georgia Tech, which is a robotics lab focused on transitioning existing robotics research to a stage where it can be directly implemented in industry. Toni aspires to join Georgia Tech’s robotics PhD program. 
Toni’s contribution to this project includes working on programming the targeting and scanning software, as well as motor control. In addition, he worked on integrating all code into the main program.</p>

<h2 id="aaron">Aaron</h2>

<p>Aaron is a first year Mechanical Engineering M.S. student at Georgia Institute of Technology. He received a B.S. in physics and a minor in applied math from the University of Dallas in Irving Texas. His love of all things science and engineering started at an early age and was encouraged by his parents who gave him a room in the family’s workshop where he could keep his projects and tinker. He is currently part of the HyTech racing club at GT and his hobbies include model rocketry, 3D printing, Arduino, hiking, and target shooting.
Aaron’s part in the SmartSrinkler project involved mostly the mechanical and electrical side. It was his job to design and construct the complete housing, the shield to interface all the components with the Raspberry Pi, as well as the power and water cannon systems. He also handled all the electrical interfacing between all the different parts of the system. In addition to these tasks, he made an exploding view animation in SolidWorks to showcase the completed housing model.</p>

<h2 id="daniel">Daniel</h2>

<p>Daniel is working on getting his Masters from Georgia Tech in Mechanical Engineering. He got his B.S. from the University of California, San Diego (also in M.E.) and worked for a while in the Aerospace industry before returning to education. His hobbies include hiking, reading, cooking, and all things dog related.
Daniel’s contribution to this project includes the Image Processing and general coding, as well as Raspberry Pi setup and troubleshooting.</p>
